<h1>METU IEEE Pixery Hackathon Project</h1>
	We created an app using augmented reality with Vuforia to clean the event grounds by making people collect the trashes they had thrown after events such as concerts and expositions. First, the organizers will create an “event” using our app and after that participants in the event grounds will collect and throw trashes at shown bins to gain points. At the end of the event, the person who has gotten the highest score by collecting trashes will be given a reward determined by the organizers.
	This project won the competition.
